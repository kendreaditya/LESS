# LESS Analysis Project

## Overview

This project implements the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) and provides tools for analyzing joint angles during the gait cycle. It is based on the data from the study by Padua et al. (2009) on the validity and reliability of the LESS.

### LESS Package

The `LESS` package contains the core functionality of the project.

- `__init__.py`: Implements the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) based on the data from Padua et al. (2009).
- `angles.py`: Provides functions for analyzing joint angles during the gait cycle. It includes implementations based on the kinematic tables from the LESS study.
