# LESS Analysis Project

## Overview

This project implements the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) and provides tools for analyzing joint angles during the gait cycle. It is based on the data from the study by Padua et al. (2009) on the validity and reliability of the LESS.

### LESS Package

The `LESS` package contains the core functionality of the project.

- `__init__.py`: Implements the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) based on the data from Padua et al. (2009).
- `angledist.py`: Provides functions for analyzing the distribution of joint angles during the gait cycle.

### Additional Scripts

- `LESS_scoreing.py`: Script for scoring the LESS based on video input.
- `acceleration_analysis.py`: Script for analyzing acceleration data during the gait cycle.
- `pose.py`: Script for pose estimation and analysis.

### Outputs

The `outputs` directory contains the output files generated by the analysis scripts.

- `LESS_scoring.mp4`: Video output of the LESS scoring.
- `output.mp4`: General output video.
- `output_with_acceleration.mp4`: Video output with acceleration analysis.
- `pose.mov`: Video output of pose estimation.

### Tests

The `tests` directory contains unit tests for the project.

- `LESS.py`: Unit tests for the LESS implementation.
- `angles.py`: Unit tests for the angle analysis functions.
- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the tests package.

### Tools

The `tools` directory contains additional utility scripts.

- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the tools package that includes caclulation of joint angles and acceleration.
